### Hi there :wave:

My name is Brian from the United States. I have just graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science.  I have experience with Java, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and Angular. I completed my first client project with OakRidge National Labs (ORNL) in the creation of a weather archive data retrival tool in May of 2022. You can see the code in my ORNL-Weather-Project Repo. Please feel free to contact me @ bskemp01@gmail.com for any inquiries or even just to say hello.
