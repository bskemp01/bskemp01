### Hi there :wave:

My name is Brian from the United States. I am currently a senior working towards my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Tennessee Technological University. I have no collaborated on any moajor projects as of yet but i will update this README as this occurs. I am however interested in Java, C++, and python coding. I would like to get more experience in other genres as I become familiar with them.
